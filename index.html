    <p>At the tender age of 16,<br>My life was turned upside by a fierce tornado.<br>
       Lets name it "Responsibilty". I couldn't run away fast enough!<br>Responsibilty is too big and too strong!<br> 
       Before I knew it, <strong><u>Responsibilty had taking me away from the innocence I once knew!</strong></u></p>

      <p id="testP" class="funParagraph">I had passed out on the jorney. When I awaken I was in a town where it was full of fast food restaurants. <br>
         I stopped at mulitple restaurants to explore their communities. There was an Mcdonalds, Steak 'n' Shake,<br> White Castle and an Sonic that welcomed me
         in to be an helper. There was something in me that wanted more than to be stuck here in this town.<br> There had to be a better town with better expericences that just serving food!<br>
