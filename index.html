      <p class="funParagraph">I had passed out on the jorney. When I awaken I was in a town where it was full of fast food restaurants. <br>
         I stopped at mulitple restaurants to explore their communities. There was an Mcdonalds, Steak 'n' Shake,<br> White Castle and an Sonic that welcomed me
